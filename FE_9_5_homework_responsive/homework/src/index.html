      <h2>The dark side of the moon is a myth</h2>
      <p>In reality both sides of the Moon see the same amount of sunlight however only one face of the Moon is ever seen from Earth. This is because the Moon rotates around on its own axis in exactly the same time it takes to orbit the Earth, meaning the same side is always facing the Earth. The side facing away from Earth has only been seen by the human eye from spacecraft.</p>

      <h2>The rise and fall of the tides on Earth is caused by the Moon.</h2>
      <p>There are two bulges in the Earth due to the gravitational pull that the Moon exerts; one on the side facing the Moon, and the other on the opposite side that faces away from the Moon, The bugles move around the oceans as the Earth rotates, causing high and low tides around the globe.</p>

      <h2>The Moon is drifting away from the Earth.</h2>
      <p>The Moon is moving approximately 3.8 cm away from our planetevery year. It is estimated that it will be continue to do so far around 50 billion years. By the time that happens, the Moon will be taking around 47 days to orbit the Earth instead of the current 27.3 days.</p>

      <h2>A person would weigh much less on the Moon.</h2>
      <p>The Moon has much weaker gravity than Earth, due to its smaller mass, so you would weigh about one sixth (16.5%) of your weight on Earth. This why the lunar astronauts could leap and bound so high in the ear.</p>

      <h2>The Moon has only been walked on by 12 people; All American males.</h2>
      <p>The first man to set foot on the Moon in 1969 was Meil Armstrong on the Apollo 11 mission, while the last man to walk on the Moon in 1972 was Gene Gernan on the Apollo 17 mission. Since then the Moon has only be visited by unmanned vehicles.</p>

      <h2>The Moon has no no atmosphere.</h2>
      <p>This means that the surface on the Moon is unprotected from cosmic rays, meteorites and solar winds, and has huge temperature variations. The lack of atmosphere means no sound can be heard on the Moon, and the sky always appears black.</p>

    <div class="element-cont elem13">
      <h2>The Moon has quakes.</h2>
      <p>These are caused by the gravitational pull of the Earth. Lunar astronauts used seismographs on their visits to the Moon, and found that small moonquakes occurred several kilometres beneath the surface, causing raptures and cracks. Scientistics think the has a molten core, just like Earth.</p>

      <h2>The first spacecraft to reach the Moon was Luna 1 in 1959.</h2>
      <p>This was a Soviet craft, which was launched from the USSR. It passed within 5995 km of the surface of tne Moon before going into orbit around the Sun</p>

      <h2>The Moon will be visited by man in the near future.</h2>
      <p>NASA plans to return astronauts to the moon to set up a permanent space station.Mankind may once again walk on the moon in 2019, if all goes according to plan</p>

      <h2>During the 1950â€™s the USA considered detonation a nuclear bomb on the Moon.</h2>
      <p>The secret project was during the height cold war was known as "A Study of Lunar Research Flights" or "Project A119" and meant as a show of strength at a time they were lagging behind in the space race. </p>
